# ising_sampling

A Python class to initialise an arbitrary Ising model (all-to-all, spin glass...) and sample from it with the Gibbs algorithm.

## Future work

* Ideally, fit a spin glass to data
* Speed up using Cython (already in branch)
* Improve the sampling algorithm with modern MCMC
* Add nearest-neighbour hamiltonian support
* Add {-1, 1} spins mode
